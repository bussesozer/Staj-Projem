                It is widely believed that masterbatch increases colorant dispersion to an optimal level for plastics and <a href="https://www.budingroup.com/products/masterbatches/additives/" target="_blank">plastic additives</a>. It offers better color consistency,
                allowing manufacturers to easily control and manage the opacity and transparency of the end products.

                Masterbatches give colors to the plastic material and many desired qualities and properties. 
                The colors can range from black, white and red to transparent colors and shades.
                Heat resistance, UV protection and other properties are given to the final plastic products using a suitable masterbatch.
                Pigments or additives are needed to give plastic products the desired color. These main groups provide the pigment. 
                These pigments are black, colored, and white. Mixing these pigments creates different colors. It can be masterbatch, plastic, or rubber.

                    There are basically two types of masterbatch. <a href="https://www.budingroup.com/products/masterbatches/color-masterbatches/" target="_blank">Color masterbatch</a> 
                    and additive masterbatch. The colored masterbatch gives the plastic product color. 
                    The additive masterbatch adds other properties such as durability or determines the texture of the plastic. 
                    The additive masterbatch also gives the plastic antistatic, antifouling and lubricating properties. 
                    In addition to the basic colors, manufacturers give the plastic many shades and special effects. 
                    These special effects can be marble, pearl, metallic, glitter, granite and phosphorescence. 
                    Masterbatch is available in granular and coarsely cut forms. It can be pellets and mini pellets in granular form.
                    It comes in roughly cut form, pieces, and small mirrors. The global masterbatch market is segmented on the basis of color, region and application. 
                    The color component of masterbatches is expected to play an important role in accelerating market growth. 
                    This is because the main batch color has many unique properties. The properties of color help a plastic find a role in a wide variety of applications and industries. 
                    The color aspect of masterbatch is determined by the need for end product users and manufacturers to differentiate the product. 
                    Almost all end products use color in their marketing strategy. 
                    One company's brand is different from the other through the use of a specific color in the company's logo and branding.
